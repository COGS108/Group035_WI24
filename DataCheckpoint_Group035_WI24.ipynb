    "The sport of powerlifting consists of 3 main **events**. The squat, the bench press, and the deadlift. A powerlifting competition gives you 3 attempts at the squat, 3 for the bench press, and 3 for the deadlift, and per event, each attempt must be heavier than the last (within the event), with the max weight lifted in each event summing up to the competitor's \"**total**\" for a meet. \n",
    "\n",
    "When competing in a powerlifting competition, choosing how much weight you'll be lifting has a lot of factors incorporated into it such as your own ability to judge the difficulty of your previous attempts and how you performed on those attempts. As such, attempt selection is an incredibly important skill a powerlifter must attain if they want to be successful in the sport. Seasoned coaches in the sport suggest that attempts start at around 90% of an athlete's max in the event. With 5% jumps between attempts being suggested from attempt 1 to 2, and <3% between attempt 2 and 3. It is also noted that heavier jumps may occur in the last event, the deadlift, due to it being the most exciting event of a powerlifting meet and/or the unique rules that come from it being the final event of a meet. <a name=\"cite_note-1\"></a> [<sup>1</sup>](#cite_ref-1) \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the hype around the deadlift event comes from it contributing on average >40% of an athelete's total regardless of gender according to a previous analysis of the dataset by Kaggle user Steven Wilson <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). The importance of a lifter's deadlift fuels our hypothesis that maybe this lift comes with even higher/riskier jumps in weight per attempt on average. Another thing we can learn from Wilson's analysis and build on is that a larger portion of Men's totals is made up by their bench press, with it making up around 25% of their total in comparison to female lifters where it only makes up 20%. The study also shows the almost trivial trend of a higher athlete body weight being associated with higher totals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prior work mostly looks at statistics of powerlifting like athlete totals rather than seeing some psychology behind the sport. We set out to uncover unconscious biases in weight selection for each attempt. If we discover that these biases exist and are significant, then this would help athletes plan out their attempts more efficiently. Athletes could then choose to be more conservative if planning a risky jump (being concious that they may be susceptible to biases found in this project), potentially adding more pounds or kilograms to their meet total rather than failing their next attempt or vice versa if we find out that their category tend to play more conservative. \n",

    "1. We believe there will be no difference between genders when it comes to attempt selection in general. We think this because the different distributions of weight selection a per-event basis will balance eachother out to be equal when comparing just by gender. For example, although women may choose higher squat attempts, their bench attempts will might be lower and vice versa for men.\n",
    "2. The deadlift will have the higher jumps due to the hype around the amount of weight lifted and it being the main contributor to an athlete's total.\n",
    "3. Following from the last prediction, and from Wilson's past research on contribution of an event to an athlete's total, we predict that on a per-event basis there will be a difference between men and women's jumps, e.g. since more of men's totals is made up of the bench press, they might have higher jumps than women in the bench press. \n"

A row contains their age/weight data, what events they decided to compete in, whether they competed Equipped (certain competitions dont allow certain equipment to be used during a lift), geographic data like country,state,town, as well as the name of the Competition. It also includes rows of different scoring systems that take weight, gender, and total lifted in order to compare one's performance to another across varying weight/sex classes. All weight data is stored in Kilograms.\n",

    "Powerlifting is a sport where the philosophy behind the sport varies drastically. As such, there are results from 300+ federations in this dataset with their own rules behind what counts as a \"valid lift\". This also includes each federation having their own weight classes. Thankfully, the raw bodyweight a lifter weighed in at on the day of the competition is included as one of the columns, and 5 different scores are precomputed as columns if a lifter's performance was able to be scored.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to compare lifters in this dataset, we will standardize to one weight class category, and one scoring system. Weight classes will be standardized to those that the International Powerlifting Federation uses (with some caveats, since the cutoffs are different for Female and Male lifters). DOTS will be our selected scoring system because it does not require that an athlete complete all 3 lifts to be calculated and is actively used today.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to calculate the jumps between a lifter's Squat 1 and Squat 2 attempt, which will be calculated in the following section. In this dataset, a failed attempt is set to the negative of the attempt weight. This means if there is a -100 in the Squat1Kg column, the lifter attempted 100kg and failed the attempt. Even if an attempt is failed, they are not allowed to lower the weight for the next attempt, so these 0% jumps should be ignored as to not skew any averages we compute."

In this study, we will standardize the weight classes used by the International Powerlifting Federation, which hosts world championships, and can be seen as a \"Parent Federation\" in the dataset for federations worldwide, this means they all follow and conform to IPF guidelines to some degree. It's popularity worldwide made us choose it for this standardization. \n",

Our dataset, sourced from Openpowerlifting.com, provides valuable information on powerlifting competitions, but we recognize the importance of safeguarding the privacy of individuals involved. We will ensure that the data used is anonymized and that participants' consent to data usage is respected, given that the information is publicly available. Additionally, we acknowledge potential biases within the dataset, including underrepresentation of certain demographic groups in powerlifting competitions. To mitigate these biases, we will conduct thorough exploratory data analysis to identify any imbalances and employ strategies such as stratification or oversampling to ensure equitable analysis.\n",

We will present findings in a fair and balanced manner, highlighting uncertainties and caveats associated with the analysis. Post-analysis, we will critically review our findings to assess their implications on different demographic groups and engage in ongoing dialogue with stakeholders to address concerns related to equity and fairness. Our research will adhere to ethical guidelines and best practices in data science, prioritizing transparency, accountability, and respect for the rights and dignity of research participants. By upholding these principles, we aim to contribute responsibly to the understanding of attempt selection in powerlifting while promoting inclusivity and ethical data use."
