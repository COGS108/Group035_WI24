    "  - Link to the dataset: {KAGGLE LINK HERE}\n",
    "  - Number of observations: 3,043,013\n",
    "  - Number of variables: 38\n",
    "\n",
    "The Openpowerlifting dataset is a collection of archived powerlifting competition results from 1946 - 1/1/2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every row of the OpenPowerlifting dataset consists of a record of how a lifter did during a competition. A row contains their age/weight data, what events they decided to compete in, whether they competed Equipped (certain competitions dont allow certain equipment to be used during a lift), geographic data like country,state,town, as well as the name of the Competition. It also includes rows of different scoring systems that take weight, gender, and total lifted in order to compare one's performance to another across varying weight/sex classes. All weight data is stored in Kilograms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Powerlifting is a sport where the philosophy behind the sport varies drastically. As such, there are results from 300+ federations in this dataset with their own rules behind what counts as a \"valid lift\". This also includes each federation having their own weight classes. Thankfully, the raw bodyweight a lifter weighed in at on the day of the competition is included as one of the columns, and 5 different scores are precomputed as columns if a lifter's performance was able to be scored.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to compare lifters in this dataset, we will standardize to one weight class category, and one scoring system. Weight classes will be standardized to those that the International Powerlifting Federation uses (with some caveats, since the cutoffs are different for Female and Male lifters). DOTS will be our selected scoring system because it does not require that an athlete complete all 3 lifts to be calculated and is actively used today.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to calculate the jumps between a lifter's Squat 1 and Squat 2 attempt, which will be calculated in the following section. In this dataset, a failed attempt is set to the negative of the attempt weight. This means if there is a -100 in the Squat1Kg column, the lifter attempted 100kg and failed the attempt. Even if an attempt is failed, they are not allowed to lower the weight for the next attempt, so these 0% jumps should be ignored as to not skew any averages we compute.\n",
